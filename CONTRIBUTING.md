# **CONTRIBUTING.md – HyperAgency Agentic AI OS**

## 1. Welcome

## 2. Contributor Rights and Licensing

When you contribute to HyperAgency, here’s what you need to know:

### **Ownership of Your Work**

* Any **agents, HyperAgent Apps, workflows, or other creations** you build **on top of HyperAgency** remain **fully yours**.
* You decide how to license or use these creations — HyperAgency does **not take ownership** of your agents or apps.

### **Contributions to the Platform Code**

* If you **modify or improve the core HyperAgency OS, bridges, or modules**, you grant Vuics LLC a **perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free license** to use, modify, integrate, and relicense your contribution under:

  * Apache 2.0 NC (for non-commercial use)
  * AGPL-3.0 (for commercial open-source use)
  * Commercial License (for closed-source enterprise use)

* This ensures contributions can be safely integrated and redistributed under the **triple-license model**.

### **Moral Rights Waiver**

* By contributing, you **waive moral rights** to the extent allowed by law.
* This allows Vuics LLC to modify, repackage, distribute, or relicense your contribution safely.

### **Copyright Assignment (Optional)**

* Most contributions are handled with a **license**, not copyright transfer.
* In special cases (e.g., core modules or premium bridges), Vuics LLC may request **copyright assignment**. This is **optional** and will be clearly communicated.
* Even without assignment, Vuics LLC has all the rights needed to integrate and relicense contributions.

### **Why This Matters**

* Protects you: you keep ownership of your creations.
* Protects Vuics LLC: ensures HyperAgency can safely grow and integrate contributions.
* Protects the ecosystem: contributors and enterprises can rely on consistent licensing and legal clarity.

> **Before submitting a contribution, please sign the [CLA](./CLA.md).**

## 4. Code Style & Testing

- Follow the existing **JavaScript/Node.js/Python conventions** (or the chosen stack).  
- Use **semantic commits** where possible.  
- Currently, HyperAgency does **not have an automated test suite**, so all code is tested manually.  
- Contributors should **verify their changes manually** by running the platform and checking that new or modified functionality works as expected.  
- When automated tests are added in the future, contributors will be expected to include unit or integration tests for new features or bug fixes.
- Even if you don’t have tests now, you can encourage contributors to start adding tests incrementally:

> Note: While automated tests are not yet available, contributions that include test cases are **highly encouraged**. This helps improve platform stability and will make your contribution easier to integrate when a test suite is added.

* Use the GitHub **Issues tab** for bug reports or feature requests.
* Include:

  * Steps to reproduce
  * Expected vs actual behavior
  * Environment details (OS, React.js/Node.js/Python version, HyperAgency version, etc.)
