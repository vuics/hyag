# Licensing FAQ

### Why not use MIT or Apache without modifications?
Those licenses allow unrestricted commercial usage. To protect sustainable
development, HyperAgency uses a Non-Commercial variant for free use.

### Is HyperAgency open-source?
Yes. The full source is available. The licenses determine how it may be used.

### Can I use HyperAgency to build a commercial SaaS?
Yes, but only if:
- You release all modifications under AGPL-3.0; OR
- You purchase a commercial license for closed-source use.

### Can I fork the project?
Yes.
- Non-commercial forks → allowed under Apache-2.0-NC  
- Commercial forks → must follow AGPL-3.0 or Commercial licensing  

### Why AGPL-3.0?
AGPL ensures improvements by commercial users are contributed back, preventing
closed forks unless a commercial license is purchased.

### I'm a student / researcher / hobbyist. Do I pay anything?
No. Use it freely under Apache-2.0-NC.

### My company wants to keep modifications private. What do we need?
A **Commercial License**.
