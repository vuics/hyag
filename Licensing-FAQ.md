# HyperAgency Licensing FAQ

---

### **1. Why not use MIT or Apache without modifications?**

MIT and standard Apache licenses allow unrestricted commercial usage. To protect **sustainable development** and ensure commercial users contribute back or pay, HyperAgency uses a **Non-Commercial variant** for free use.

---

### **2. Is HyperAgency open-source?**

Yes. The **full source code** is available. The licenses define **how it may be used**, including commercial and non-commercial applications.

---

### **3. Which license should I choose?**

| You are…                                                                  | Recommended License    | Notes                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Student, hobbyist, enthusiast, developer, academic, researcher, professor | **Apache-2.0-NC**      | Free to use, learn, and experiment; cannot monetize commercially                                   |
| Early-stage startup team                                                  | **AGPL-3.0**           | Can use commercially if you **share modifications**; encourages contributions back to the platform |
| Enterprise, closed-source company                                         | **Commercial License** | Required for proprietary deployments or SaaS offerings; includes premium modules and support       |

> ⚠️ Tip: If your use case spans multiple categories (e.g., a startup using it for research internally), choose the **license that matches your intended commercial deployment**.

---

### **4. Can I use HyperAgency to build a commercial SaaS?**

Yes, but only if:

* You release **all modifications under AGPL-3.0**; **OR**
* You purchase a **commercial license** for closed-source use.

---

### **5. Can I fork the project?**

Yes.

* **Non-commercial forks** → Allowed under Apache-2.0-NC
* **Commercial forks** → Must follow AGPL-3.0 (for open-source) or Commercial License (for closed-source)

---

### **6. Why AGPL-3.0?**

AGPL ensures that **improvements made by commercial users are contributed back**, preventing companies from keeping modifications private unless a commercial license is purchased.

---

### **7. I’m a student, researcher, or hobbyist. Do I pay anything?**

No. You can use HyperAgency freely under **Apache-2.0-NC**.

---

### **8. My company wants to keep modifications private. What do we need?**

A **Commercial License** is required for proprietary or closed-source deployment. This includes access to **premium modules, cloud integrations, and official support**.

---

### **9. Additional Notes**

* Triple-license strategy ensures:

  1. **Low-friction adoption** for non-commercial users.
  2. **Early-stage startups** can experiment and contribute.
  3. **Enterprises** pay for closed-source usage, maximizing monetization.
* Always **choose the license that matches your intended use**. Violating the license may result in enforcement action.
